# HackTogether(s)

HackTogethers are get-togethers where we propose new problems that the Byld community is collectively interested in, work on solutions, work on existing projects, and most importantly -- document and commit all the work done so that someone can build atop it.

Ideas which fall under the scope of hacktogethers include institute portals; utilities that are useful for academics, campus life, or Byld activities and sessions.

HackTogethers are a part of [The Projects Plan](https://github.com/IIIT-Delhi/byld-website/wiki/The-Projects-Plan). 

## Proposals 

Check out the [issues](https://github.com/IIIT-Delhi/hacktogethers/issues) or the [board](https://github.com/IIIT-Delhi/hacktogethers/projects/1) for proposed, work in progress and live projects.

The top comment of the issue is edited so that it's always up-to-date with the latest status info, and replies are for discussion.

## How do I propose something?

You can present it at the next HackTogether! Contact @peey to make this happen. We are using this repo to track all the ideas so you should also [open an issue from idea or problem templates](https://github.com/IIIT-Delhi/hacktogethers/issues/new/choose).

Do make sure that it falls under the scope of Byld's projects (see intro). If it doesn't, then ProjectHub isn't the right place for it.

## Problems, Ideas, and Implementations

It's important to make the distinction. There can be many ideas to solve a problem, and many implementations of an idea. For instance, if a problem is that we don't see enough cute cat pictures in a day then an idea could be to make a telegram channel where a bot posts top-voted Reddit cat pictures, and another idea could be to make a browser extension that modifies your page content to randomly embed a cat picture while you work. There might be two implementations of the telegram bot, one might be a python server which polls Reddit every few hours for new pictures and stores them, and one might be a node.js server which uses webhooks to be notified every time a new post is made. 

As hackers, you may think one idea is better than the other or one way of implementing is better than the other. It's encouraged that you work on what you think is the best way to solve the problem. All the while, we encourage you to keep this in mind:

> If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together

You'll find that to build things which are actually usable, you have to keep the code maintained and complete. Working in teams, you can have a broader coverage of features, and complete your implementation faster. It's encouraged that you collaborate on implementations with people who have similar ideas as you do. We suggest dividing up responsibilities for successful collaboration.

## Rough Sketch for the Session

At the beginning of the session, presenters pitch some problems, ideas, or implementations. After that, it'll just be you, your code, snacks and hacking away into the night. You can collaborate with anyone you like or work on something on your own.

It's very important to document and commit all the work you've done so far before you wrap up. Your hours of coding and figuring things out will be wasted if you or someone else is not able to continue it. An admin / session host will update 

This is a very rough sketch, and we'll figure out details as we have more of these events. If you have suggestions, feel free to contact [@peey](http://github.com/peey).

## I've got more questions

Feel free to open a [plain issue](https://github.com/IIIT-Delhi/hacktogethers/issues/new) to discuss anything about hacktogether or suggest changes to the repo organization / process.
